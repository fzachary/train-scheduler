# Train Scheduler

Train Scheduler is a JavaScript web application that lets a user add a train to a table showing data for multiple trains, such as the name of the train, the train's destination, the time of the next departure, the frequency at which the train departs, and how long until the next departure (in minutes).

## Usage

The app is used by simply typing the data for the train you want to track into the data form and hitting submit. The information will be stored in a real-time database, and will persist and repopulate the page on refresh. Simply look at the table of the rendered data to see the information about the trains.

## CDNs

Train Scheduler is styled using Bootstrap 4. I also used JQuery for DOM manipulation, Google Firebase for the real-time database, and Moment.js for the time features.
